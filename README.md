# TwitterApp

Unfinished YET.

App should be a third party between user and their Twitter account, that after authorization should allow posting tweets from this user account. For training purposes using third party API e.g. TwitterJ was avoided. 
Unfortunately Twitter API is not too helpful with debugging by returning very little info. Therefore suspended for now.
